We can see that at as the amount of aggregation increases, the log-likelihood increases, and the choice of aggregation function matters less. This is in line with what we would expect, but the converged parameters in the coarser cases may lose some of the subtle interactions between microzones.
It is also interesting to note that the log-likelihoods of the physical and fully-connected graphs are very similar.}

\section{Results and Discussion}


In this section, we discuss the results from running IPF over the two MRF graph structures representing the microzones in the south-west corner of Soda Hall's AMPlab.

\subsection{Data Aggregation and Log-Likelihood}

Because we were not sure what method and degree of aggregation would perform best for our task, we explored various degrees and types of aggregation.
The resulting log-likelihoods from converged IPF runs over the two graphs are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:loglikelihood}.
While the \texttt{mean} aggregation function consistently results in lower log-likelihoods for all window sizes in both graphs, the log-likelihoods do converge to very similar values (-1494, -1504, -1488 for \texttt{mean}, \texttt{min} and \texttt{max} for 30-minute window aggregation on the physical graph, for example) with higher degrees of aggregation, regardless of the choice of function.
Also interesting is the fact that both the fully-connected and physical graphs have similar log-likelihoods.
At the 30-minute aggregation level, the fully-connected graph has a log-likelihood about 100 higher than that of the physical graph, but as we will discuss below, this higher log-likelihood does not actually correlate with a more useful set of parameters.

After running IPF, we get back an array of $2\times 2$ matrices, each representing an edge parameter from the graphical structure.
For each element in the pairwise edge parameter matrix --- (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1) --- we plot the confusion matrix for all edges in the graph (Figures ~\ref{fig:30minminphysical} and \ref{fig:30minminfull}).
We now give a brief overview of what we expect to find in each of these matrices:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
\item (0,0): The more positive an entry in this matrix is, the stronger the thermal \emph{cooling} coupling between the two microzones.
If an entry is low (or negative), then this likely means that one of the zones tends to retain heat rather than dissipate it (which may be due to the HVAC system).
\item (0,1) and (1,0): These two matrices represent the strength of the negative coupling between two microzones, that is, how likely is it that one will heat and one will cool in the same time window.
We expect to see mainly negative values here; there are no strong physical mechanisms that would cause a strong inverse thermal connection between two microzones.
Small values (either positive or negative) suggest that the zones have little to no thermal influence on each other.
\item (1,1): The more positive an entry in this matrix is, the stronger the thermal \emph{heating} coupling between the two microzones.
Low (but not not negative) values here means that the two microzones do not heat up together that often, which suggests that there is a temperature gradient.
If these two microzones are in the same HVAC zone (that is, they are supplied by the same VAV), then this is likely a source of discomfort.
High positive values here suggest that the two zones often heat up together at the same time, which may indicate an unintended thermal coupling.

\subsection{Interesting Edge Potentials}

For each of these, refer back to Figure~\ref{fig:soda_amp_microzones} for the physical spaces the microzone numbers represent.

\textbf{30-minute Physical Graph} (Figure~\ref{fig:30minminphysical}):

The highly aggregated data run against the physical graph both confirms our expectations of how the space behaves thermally, but also gives us a family of interesting takeaways that we can use for further exploration:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
\item Microzones 1 and 2, which subdivide an open office space, have a strong thermal coupling as indicated in the (0,0) and (1,1) plots; this is a validation that our parameter estimation matches our expectations of the physical world.
\item Microzones 2 and 3, which share a window, have a non-trivial thermal coupling, showing that although the BMS considers them to be in separate HVAC zones, there is some leakage between them.
\item Microzones 9 and 10, which are separated by a door, have a much higher degree of thermal coupling than any other two microzones connected by a door.
Because microzone 9 is a rarely-used room, it is worth exploring where the thermostat is placed; if the thermostat is in microzone 9, then the conference room in microzones 10 and 11 will be influenced by the temperature in a room where no one is.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{30-minute Full Graph} (Figure~\ref{fig:30minminfull}):

While the highly aggregated data run against the fully-connected graph makes fewer assumptions about the nature of the physical space and has a similar (in fact, lower) log-likelihood to the 30-minute model run on the physical graph, it does not end up capturing the direct thermal coupling.
However, it does capture the external thermal effect of sunlight: microzones 1, 10 and 11 all have south-facing windows, which receive a significant amount of sun during the day.
This can be seen in the high positive values in the (1,1) matrix.

\subsection{Discussion}

Because this project was primarily an exploration of a particular graphical model approach to a problem traditionally served by brittle, heavyweight, expert-derived building simulation models, it is worth discussing the utility of such a method.
While we had to drastically simplify the model in order to make solving it computationally tractable, we were able to pull some useful conclusions from the converged estimated parameters.
However, this run was only on a small subset of a single floor of a single building, using only a week's worth of data.
In parallel with this small graph representing the south-west corner of Soda Hall's AMPlab, we were also exploring a larger, more connected graph representing the 4th floor of Sutardja Dai Hall using a month's worth of temperature data from a similar sensor deployment.
Despite running for more than half a week, IPF did not converge on this model, suggesting that IPF's utility is lessened for larger models.
As a subject of future work, we want to explore more efficient IPF methods to see if parameter estimation on these larger, more useful, graphical models becomes tractable.

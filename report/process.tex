do we need this?
Approach: "quick" overview section
- explicitly what we're going to do
- how we're going to do it
- "now we go into more detail" etc

Architecture of System:
- sensors, database:
    - KETI and the Soda deployment
- data processing pipeline:
    - need for data cleaning; complications w/ sensors ('real world')
    - how to do data cleaning, the transformations we did
- Octave script to run IPF, generate edge parameters:
    - what would the results look like and what would we expect?

Problem Setup:
- how do decompose the space, the buildings, etc we used into graph
- go over options in how we could have represented:
    - bucketing temperature
    - more nodes; more accurate? more sensors

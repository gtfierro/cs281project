\section{Conclusion}

This project explored the application of the iterative proportional fitting algorithm to parameter estimation in a Markov random field representing the collection of microzones in a building.
The converged edge parameters represent the strength of the thermal coupling between two microzones, which helps researchers, administrators and building managers reason about possible comfort and inefficiency problems in a building.
While effective in a small graph and limited data, this method needs a more efficient algorithmic approach in order to be more generally applicable.
